# google-search-results-page

Google search results page! Made purely with HTML and CSS as a small project for The Odin Project (just like the last project).

Some things to note in this project
* I definitely underestimated the amount of time this would take to make. Maybe I'm just slow? I initially planned on [doing more](https://i.imgur.com/sA6abKE.png) but I preferred to finish the project so I can move on and start coding with JavaScript.
* The [material icons provided by Google](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_icons) are a pretty handy resource for icons in general. I found these later on, which is why some of the code has arrows as images.
* I was a bit upset that I didn't know how to copy the "Goooooooooogle" at the bottom but I'm pretty happy with how my recreation of it looks!
* I didn't put in a lot of effort into making it responsive! For the same reason as mentioned in the first bullet.
